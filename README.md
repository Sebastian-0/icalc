# iCalc

A PWA calculator that adds features missing from the default Calculator app in iOS.

## Why?

Main motivation:
- The built in iOS calculator does not have support for moving the cursor when writing expressions
- The app-store is filled with garbage apps that barely work, either at a price of full of ads 

I want a simple calculatore which focuses on ease of use, which is lightweight and free to use.

## Features

- Editable expressions with movable cursor
- Calculation history (persists across sessions)

## Install

### iPhone (Safari)
1. Open [icalc-sebastian.netlify.app](https://icalc-sebastian.netlify.app) in Safari
2. Tap Share (square with arrow)
3. Tap "Add to Home Screen"

### Android (Chrome)
1. Open [icalc-sebastian.netlify.app](https://icalc-sebastian.netlify.app) in Chrome
2. Tap menu (three dots) → "Add to Home Screen" or "Install app"

The app runs fullscreen like a native app and works offline.
