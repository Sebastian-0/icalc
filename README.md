# iCalc

A PWA calculator for iOS that adds features missing from the default Calculator app.

## Why?

Main motivation:
- The built in iOS calculator does not have support for moving the cursor when writing expressions
- The app-store is filled with garbage apps that barely work, either at a price of full of ads 

I want a simple calculatore which focuses on ease of use, which is lightweight and free to use.

## Features

- Editable expressions with movable cursor
- Calculation history (persists across sessions)

## Install on iPhone

1. Open [https://icalc-sebastian.netlify.app](https://icalc-sebastian.netlify.app) in Safari
2. Tap the Share button (square with arrow)
3. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Tap "Add"

The app icon appears on your home screen and runs fullscreen like a native app.
